## 📝 Description

**Daily-Fault-Reporting** is the core hub of a solution designed for managing and reporting daily operational faults. This repository acts as the primary entry point, combining the user-friendliness of visual interfaces with the power of robust automation scripts.

Its goal is to transform raw data from various sources into structured reports, facilitating real-time decision-making and error monitoring.

## 💡 Unified Concept

This project integrates the capabilities of my two main developments:
1. **User Interface:** Inspired by the simplicity and categorization of *Aurora Bright*.
2. **Automation Engine:** Based on the processing logic and security of *Report Automation System V2*.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **📡 Report Consolidation:** Gathers faults detected across different areas into a single master document.
* **⚡ Simplified Pipeline:** Direct execution of cleanup, download, and processing tasks.
* **🔍 Error Monitoring:** Detection system for "KO" statuses and disconnected records.
* **🛡️ Standard Security:** Configuration management via environment variables to protect data flow.
